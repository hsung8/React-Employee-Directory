# React-Employee-Directory

This app is a employee directory bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).. To build this app, the application's UI was broken into components to manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
